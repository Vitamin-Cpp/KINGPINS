DAILY SCRUM MEETINGS 2
Each meeting with a duration of 15 minutes.
14 APRIL 2021
Can only set up server on campus using the Wits Ethernet. Our Priority is the Home Page and Side Bar.
15 APRIL 2021
Diagramming. There is still a few issues with setting up the server and will try complete it tomorrow on campus to ensure everything works.
16 APRIL 2021
Server has been set successfully and will soon change the URL of server for the application.
19 APRIL 2021
Have began doing the code for the sidebar. Sidebar has Home, Dashboard, About us and Log out. It is still missing My Items, Services, Products and Favorites.
20 APRIL 2021
The side bar has been completed. All that is left to do the home page, add the profile and username.
 
21 APRIL 2021
Decided to use the lamp server for now. The logging in with Google is still not working and the team has started coding the registration part.



22 APRIL 2021
We received an email about our server request and it will be ready by the 12th of April. Login with Google and registration works successfully but the layout needs to be fixed. Thought about doing forgot password but that would not be fnished on time.
23 APRIL 2021
Design UI of login and registration has been completed. We will change to the new server once it has been set up and working perfectly. We have the diagrams that are needed but will need to confirm them.

[22:34, 4/16/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Yea and I think we should start as soon as possible.

I'm having a few issues when I try set up the server ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄ‚Äç
[10:11, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: Today i have a very busy day but I'll try to set up the server in the evening. And in terms of android tasks i will do the things related to the profile
[10:12, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: You'll tell me how far you went with setting it up. So that i try to pick up from there 
[12:20, 4/17/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Do you use Windows or Linux?
[12:24, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: I'm on windows, will it be a problem?
[12:33, 4/17/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Im not sure or maybe I'm doing it wrong but I keep getting connection timed out and I tried other ways but same result. Like right after I put the username and password on Putty it just does a connection time out
[12:36, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: Are off campus? It said something about direct ssh from off campus cannot be granted

[12:36, 4/17/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Oh yea, that could be the reason
[12:41, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: Ahh not working,i realised it also says ssh from wits must be done via ethernet not wifi

[12:50, 4/17/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Alright. I am only able to come to campus on Monday to be able to try set up the server
[12:54, 4/17/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: I remember MJ saying setting up the server will be complicated.
And if we are having issues we can email mss.gmass@gmail.com because that's where we got the server from
[12:57, 4/17/2021] +27 79 826 0547: I think that's what we gonna have to do. But let's see if monday you'll have some luck

[04:16, 4/19/2021] Rumbi‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è: Look good but also need My Items, Services, Products and Favorites on the sidebar
[04:17, 4/19/2021] +27 81 477 3458: Yeah no biggie there and also the colors
[04:17, 4/19/2021] +27 81 477 3458: We'll have to adjust again if needed.
